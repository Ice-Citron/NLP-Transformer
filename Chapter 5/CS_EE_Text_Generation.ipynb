        "###Greedy Search Decoding\n",
        "\n",
        "Greedy search decoding is a simple and common method used in natural language processing (NLP), especially in the context of text generation with transformer models. It operates under a straightforward principle: at each step in generating text, it selects the next word that has the highest probability of occurrence given the previous words in the sequence. Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mechanism of Greedy Search Decoding\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: The process begins with an initial input, which can be a start token or a prompt provided by the user. The model uses this input to predict the probabilities of the next possible words.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Word Selection**: Out of the predicted probabilities for the next words, the word with the highest probability is chosen as the next word in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sequence Update**: This chosen word is then appended to the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repetition**: The updated sequence (original input plus the new word) is fed back into the model. This process is repeated until a stop condition is met—typically when a maximum sequence length is reached or a special end-of-sequence token is generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Output**: The final sequence of words generated through this method forms the completed text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages**:\n",
        "- **Speed**: Greedy search is computationally efficient because it only requires a single forward pass through the model to select the highest probability word at each step.\n",
        "- **Simplicity**: It is straightforward to implement and understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disadvantages**:\n",
        "- **Lack of Diversity**: Since it always chooses the most likely word, greedy search can lead to repetitive and generic text. It often misses more interesting or nuanced combinations of words that might have a slightly lower probability but could contribute to a more coherent or creative overall piece.\n",
        "- **Risk of Getting Stuck**: Greedy search can sometimes get stuck in suboptimal loops or dead ends where the text becomes nonsensical or overly repetitive, as it does not reconsider its past choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparison to Other Decoding Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast to greedy search, other decoding methods like beam search or sampling-based approaches (e.g., top-k sampling, nucleus sampling) offer alternatives that balance between the likelihood of words and the diversity of the generated text. Beam search, for instance, keeps track of a number of hypotheses at each step (the \"beam width\"), and only the best hypotheses according to their cumulative probabilities are extended. This often results in better quality outputs compared to greedy search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Greedy search is often used when a fast, deterministic output is needed, but in cases where quality and diversity of text are more important, other methods are generally preferred."

        "### What \"output\" Contains\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Logits**: Each element of the logits represents the raw score for each possible token in the model's vocabulary. The higher the score, the higher the probability of the token being the appropriate next word in the sequence, after applying a softmax function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Shape of the Output**: The shape of `output.logits` is typically `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`.\n",
        "   - **`batch_size`**: Number of sequences processed together. In your code, since you are processing one input sequence at a time, `batch_size` is 1.\n",
        "   - **`sequence_length`**: Length of the input text sequence being processed. This grows with each iteration since you are appending a new token to `input_ids` after each step.\n",
        "   - **`vocab_size`**: The total number of tokens in the model's vocabulary. This determines the last dimension's size, representing the score for each possible token.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Selection `[0, -1, :]`\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why each component of this slicing is used:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`[0]`**: Since the `batch_size` is 1, this index is used to select the output corresponding to the first and only sequence in the batch. Using batch size of 1 is common in generation tasks where sequences are generated one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`-1`**: This selects the output for the last token in the current sequence. In the context of sequential generation, the last token is where the next prediction bases upon. You continue the sequence from where it last left off, hence focusing on the output for the last token processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`:`**: This selects all elements across the last dimension, which correspond to the logits of each token in the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Implication\n",
        "\n",
        "Using `[0, -1, :]` allows the model to focus on just the necessary part of the output—specifically, the logits for the next word prediction based on the last word of the sequence. This is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations on earlier parts of the sequence that are already established in earlier steps of generation. Each iteration then builds on the previous by extending the sequence one token at a time, and this slicing ensures that only the most recent token's output is used to determine the next step in the sequence."

        "This line of code is involved in selecting specific log probabilities from a batch of sequences. Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`logp = F.log_softmax(logits, dim=-1)`**:\n",
        "   - This computes the logarithm of softmax probabilities along the last dimension (dim=-1) of the logits tensor. Assume `logits` has a shape of `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`, then `logp` will have the same shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`labels.unsqueeze(2)`**:\n",
        "   - `labels` typically has a shape of `[batch_size, sequence_length]`, where each entry is the index of the true or next token in the sequence.\n",
        "   - `unsqueeze(2)` adds a third dimension, changing its shape to `[batch_size, sequence_length, 1]`. This is necessary to make it compatible for gathering along the third dimension (vocab_size) of `logp`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`torch.gather(logp, 2, labels.unsqueeze(2))`**:\n",
        "   - This gathers values from `logp` based on indices specified in `labels`. Since `labels` now has an extra dimension, it can directly index into the vocab_size dimension of `logp`.\n",

        "Yes, your understanding is correct. `torch.gather` fundamentally gathers elements from a tensor along a specified dimension, based on indices provided in another tensor. Here's a more detailed explanation of how it operates:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Functionality of `torch.gather`\n",

        "- **dim (int)**: The dimension along which to index. This dimension will be accessed in the input tensor to select elements.\n",
        "- **index (LongTensor)**: The indices of elements to gather. This tensor must have the same shape as the input tensor, but along the specified dimension, each value must be a valid index in that dimension of the input tensor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works\n",
        "1. **Dimension Selection**: The function looks at the specified dimension (`dim`) in the input tensor.\n",
        "2. **Indexing**: For each index value in the `index` tensor, `torch.gather` picks the corresponding element from the `input` tensor along the chosen dimension.\n",
        "3. **Tensor Construction**: The output tensor is constructed using the gathered elements and retains the shape of the `index` tensor.\n",

        "Let's visualize this with a simple example. Assume you have a 2D tensor and you want to select elements from each row:\n",

For example, in classification tasks, if you have the logits for multiple classes and you know the actual classes (as indices), you can use `torch.gather` to pick out the logits for the actual classes to compute the loss using a log-softmax operation.\n",
